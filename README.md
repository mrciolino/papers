# A Comprehensive Summary of Three Years of Research Contributions in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Beyond (2019-2022) 
## [Research Overview](Research_Overview.pdf)

We have made contributions in the fields of computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, artificial intelligence, computation and language, cryptography and security, and software engineering. Our works have focused on various topics such as rapid object detection, sub-typing, text augmentation, image compression, super resolution, and adversarial risk to machine learning models. Our research has also included automating defense against adversarial attacks and discovering model characteristics through strategic probing. Additionally, we have applied our expertise to the gaming world by developing generative language models for chess and go gameplay. Our papers have been published in various formats and conferences, including SPIE, AI4I, NIAI, ICAIT, and NFCS. This is what we did.
